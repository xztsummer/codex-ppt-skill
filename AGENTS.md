## Contribution Flow

- All non-trivial changes should go through a pull request.
- PR titles must follow Conventional Commit style, for example:
  - `feat: add new slide style`
  - `fix: handle missing image API key`
  - `docs: clarify installation steps`
- Commit messages, PR titles, changelog entries, and release notes must be written in English.
- Documentation changes that affect README content must update both `README.md` and `README_en.md` in sync.

## Changelog

- User-visible changes must update `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Add unreleased entries under `## Unreleased`.
- Use one of these sections:
  - `### Features`
  - `### Improvements`
  - `### Fixes`
  - `### Documentation`
- Changelog entries must be written in English.
- Changelog entries must include the PR reference after the PR is opened, for example `(#12)`.
- If the PR number is not known when the first commit is made, open the PR first and then push a follow-up commit that adds the `(#PR_NUMBER)` reference.

## Release Process

- Versions use SemVer.
- Git tags must use a leading `v`, for example `v0.1.0`.
- GitHub Releases are generated from the matching `CHANGELOG.md` version section.
- Do not write GitHub Release notes manually unless updating an existing release body to match `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Verification

- Before opening a PR, verify changed GitHub workflow YAML parses when practical.
- For workflow shell snippets, run a syntax check such as `bash -n` when practical.
